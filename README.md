## Exploding Variance in Random Walks

Although each step in a random walk is independent and has no long-term drift, the **variance of the position** grows **without bound** as time progresses.

Formally, since each step $\varepsilon_t$ has mean 0 and variance 1:

$$
E[X_t] = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad Var(X_t) = t
$$

This means the **expected position** stays around zero, but the **dispersion**  of possible positions **increases** with time.

Visually, this is why random walk paths spread out more and more as $t$ increases â€” even though each move is small, their cumulative effect causes the position to drift farther from the origin.

In two dimensions, this idea generalizes to:

$$
E[X_t^2 + Y_t^2] = t
$$

so the **expected distance from the origin** grows proportionally to $\sqrt{t}$.
